Salt air off Port Phillip Bay leaves a residue on glass, balcony railings and metal fittings that builds up faster than most homeowners expect, and beach visits track sand into entryways and living areas most weekends. The humidity that comes with coastal exposure also raises mould risk in bathrooms and window tracks if it's not kept on top of.
